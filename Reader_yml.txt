1. Checkout the PR Code

- name: Checkout PR branch
  uses: actions/checkout@v3

2. Cache npm Dependencies

- name: Cache npm dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-

Speeds up workflow runs by caching npm packages.
Uses the hash of package-lock.json to determine cache validity.
3. Set Up Node.js

- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
 -version: '18'

Installs Node.js version 18 on the runner.
4. Install Commitlint

        'body-leading-blank': [2, 'always'],
        'footer-leading-blank': [2, 'always'],
        'signed-off-by': [2, 'always', 'Signed-off-by:']
      }
    };
    EOF

    echo "Head: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}"
    npx commitlint \
      --from=${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} \
      --to=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} \
      --verbose \
      --config=./commitlint.config.js
